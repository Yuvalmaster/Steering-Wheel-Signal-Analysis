**The Steering Wheel Movement Analysis project aims to analyze the steering wheel movement data of subjects in different conditions, including both drunk and sober individuals. 
The objective of the project is to extract relevant features from the signals to gain insights and potentially develop a classification model for detecting impairment based
on steering wheel movements.**
