# Steering Wheel Movement Analysis: Detecting Impairment through Data Analysis ðŸ›ž

The Steering Wheel Movement Analysis project is focused on analyzing the steering wheel movement data of subjects in different conditions, including both drunk and sober individuals. The project aims to extract relevant features from the signals to gain insights and potentially develop a classification model for detecting impairment based on steering wheel movements.

## Project Structure
The project consists of several files that handle different aspects of the data analysis:

* main.py: This is the main script that should be executed to view the data analysis. It serves as the entry point for the project.

* Driver.py: This file contains the driver object, which represents an individual subject in the study. It includes relevant attributes and methods for processing and analyzing the steering wheel movement data for that particular driver.

* Data_plotter.py: This file handles all the data plotting tasks. It contains functions and utilities to visualize the steering wheel movement data, such as generating plots and charts.

* Subject_Analysis.py: This file is responsible for processing and analyzing the steering wheel movement data for each driver object. It includes functions to extract relevant features from the signals, perform statistical analysis, and potentially develop a classification model for impairment detection based on the steering wheel movements.

## Accessing the Resources
To access the project resources, including the code files and the Data folder, please send an email requesting access. Once you receive the link, you can download the files and folders to explore the Steering Wheel Movement Analysis project on your local machine.

Additionally, the project has a requirements.txt file that lists the required dependencies and their versions. It is recommended to set up a conda virtual environment and install the dependencies using the command ```conda install --file requirements.txt``` to ensure compatibility and smooth execution of the project.
